- Language stuff:
    - Add lang.yml file in /lang/ directory that sets the languages, this way we dont need to have a plugin config just for that
- Common Registrar place for Mischief Plugins, so that they can get eachother without relying on statics too much


General features:
- Get things like other plugins from MischiefCore, possibly also things that hold values like CacheManager?
- Every MischiefPlugin has a LogManager, LangManager (if available) publicly available on reference
- Every MischiefPlugin registers itself in a common Database, so that other MischiefPlugins can access eachother easily
- Make sure FileUtils throws more exceptions, we shouldnt expect everything to go smoothly
